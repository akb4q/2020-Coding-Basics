a little thinking after reading Permanent File.A book about Edward Snowden.

An interesting and inspiring story of Edward Snowden.Gives us a different perspective to know about this guy and his story also a way to be awared of what Snowden has been through.Though we don,t know how many percent of the story is real or not real. In my opinion，through out the book ,what i have learn is that we don,t or we can,t know the whole picture of the story since our position in this information era. Also it provide me a new perspective to gaze at the relationship of the reality world and the net world.

I believe it’s a hint for us to re-think about our position, responsibilities, and the role we are playing in this information era.
